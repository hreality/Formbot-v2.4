ToDo:
Still tweaking and putting data in here..

Notes:
TMC Autotune:  So, installed  it (works in conjunction with Klippain) and couldnt get sensorless to function despite the 'guide' directions.  I seem to have it resolved by reading nuggets from the issues.
Changed homing speed from 25 to 45.. then ran the sequence for Klippain again. Seems to be doing as its supposed to.
